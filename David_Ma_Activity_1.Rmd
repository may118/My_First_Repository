# Main Research interest

The main focus of my research is the study of soil respiration within a deciduous and coniferous forest stand through long â€“ term automatic chambers. Then I compare and contrast different models such as the Q<sub>10</sub> model and neural networks to fit the data in order to obtain missing carbon fluxes from periods with no measurement data.

# A Chunk of Code
```{r}
#import data from excel
library(readxl)
Obs_Ts_2018 <- read_excel("E:/Insync/Classes/Geo - 712/Projects/Week 2/Homework/Obs_Ts_2018.xlsx")
#plot this data
plot(Obs_Ts_2018$Ts,Obs_Ts_2018$Obs,main = "Observed soil respiration vs. soil temperature in 2018",xlab = "Ts",ylab = "Rs")
```

# What the final result should look like (image made in matlab)
## In fact, there's a feature called a "live script" within matlab that can do exactly what markdown can do.

Here is me testing out a change which I can push out to github on the main page.
